            Mibao is my daughter- she's the most beautiful cat in the world. She came to home 
            when she was one year and two months old. 
            She is a Turkish Angora, this descent makes her look like a princess. When I decided 
            to buy a cat, in the beginning I tried to adopt one from shelter. However, the cats 
            in Boston's shelter are so popular- I couldn't even get one after waiting for one month. 
            Then I saw Mibao's picture from a breeder. She was so beautiful which made me decide to 
            buy her after considering just several days. But when she first came to the house, 
            it took her a long time to adjust to her new surroundings. At first, she had Malassezia, 
            which made her ears so itchy that she even went so far as to scratch her ears to the point 
            where she scratched the top of her head. I freaked out and bought a lot of medicine to 
            treat it. Luckily, after a month, she no longer had Malassezia in her ears and the broken 
            skin on the top of her head healed. However, the next thing I noticed was that she started licking 
            her fur out of anxiety, which Breeder told me happens to a lot of kittens when they are in 
            a new environment. So my roommate and I spent a lot of time with her every day, playing with her and 
            cuddling her. After a month, her anxiety disappeared and she began to really integrate into the family.
